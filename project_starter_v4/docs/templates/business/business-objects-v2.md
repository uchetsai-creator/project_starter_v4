# Business Process Index

<!--
  This file is the index and rule definition for all business process documents.
  Each business process has its own dedicated file under docs/business/.
  Each process file must follow the rules and format defined in this document.

  Naming convention: [process-name]-process.md
  Location: docs/business/[process-name]-process.md
  Examples:
    docs/business/order-create-process.md
    docs/business/order-cancel-process.md
    docs/business/inventory-restock-process.md

  Files matching *-process.md are automatically included in the PDF.
  After writing a new process file, run:
  Edit the ```plantuml block in the file, then rebuild PDF

* Do not put process content in this file.
* Each business process must have its own file.
* Each process file must follow the rules and format defined in this document.

### Content Rules

* Focus on WHAT happens from a business perspective.
* Do not describe which service or code handles each step.
* Do not describe validation logic or database actions.
* Technical cross-module calls belong in docs/modules/[module]/[module]-flow.md — not here.

### Activity Diagram Rules

* The activity block describes business steps and decision branches only.
* Do not reference specific services, repositories, or technical implementation in the diagram.
